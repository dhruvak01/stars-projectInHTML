		Ranbir Raj Kapoor born 28 September 1982 is an Indian actor known for his work in Hindi-language films. He is one of the highest-paid actors of Hindi cinema and has featured in Forbes India's Celebrity 100 list since 2012. Kapoor is the recipient of several awards, including six Filmfare Awards.
		<br>
		<br>
		The son of actors Rishi Kapoor and Neetu Singh, and the grandson of actor-director Raj Kapoor, Kapoor pursued filmmaking and method acting at the School of Visual Arts and the Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute, respectively. He subsequently assisted Sanjay Leela Bhansali on the film Black and made his acting debut with Bhansali's tragic romance Saawariya , a critical and commercial failure. Kapoor rose to prominence in 2009 with his performances in the coming-of-age film Wake Up Sid and the romantic comedy Ajab Prem Ki Ghazab Kahani. His most widely seen film in this period came with the political drama Raajneeti.
		<br>
		<br>
		Kapoor's performances as a troubled musician in Rockstar and a cheerful deaf-and-mute man in Barfi! earned him two consecutive Filmfare Awards for Best Actor. A leading role opposite Deepika Padukone in the romantic comedy Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani further established him as a star. This was followed by a series of commercial failures, with the exception of the romance Ae Dil Hai Mushkil. This changed in 2018 when Kapoor portrayed Sanjay Dutt in Rajkumar Hirani's biopic Sanju, one of the highest-grossing Indian films, for which he won another Best Actor award at Filmfare.
		<br>
		<br>
		In addition to his acting career, Kapoor supports charities and causes. He is also a co-owner of the Indian Super League football team Mumbai City FC. He is married to the actress Alia Bhatt.
